# Get started

You will need:

- Maven

- Java 8

Run the server from App.java and pass false to the Controller in order to only train the Feed Forward Network.
To also train the convolutional network, pass true to the Controller.

## Some things to do

- Run the Feed Forward network for more epochs (MultiLayerNetwork.java) 

- See if you can get the performance of the Feed Forward network to match the performance of the convolutional network

- PLay with the examples from DL4J (https://deeplearning4j.org/examples-tour#deeplearning4j-examples)

# More DL4J please
